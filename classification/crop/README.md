### Exploratory Data Analysis on Images
- [ ] Find duplicate images using hamming distance 
- [ ] Find the resolution of the images and its channel distribution for consistency
- [ ] In addition you could also check the aspect ratio of the images, however the above ðŸ‘† takes care of it
- [ ] Find the class distribution across images 
- [ ] Find the brightness distribution in the images 
- [ ] Find the distriution of pixel per class
- [ ] Contrast between average images 
- [ ] You can use eigenimages to identify the defining part of the images
